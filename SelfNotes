//________why using MVC ? 

/* first what are MVC , MVC a molati is an acronym for Model-View-Controller,
 an architectural design pattern used to develop interactive applications.
  It is used to separate the concerns of an application into three distinct layers, 
  each with a specific role:
      *Model: The heart of the program >>> contains data and business logic , has nothing to do with Mr View nor Mr Controller..
      *Controller: Mr controller is the Conductor >>> handles user interactions , asks models for data and send them to the views to display them .
      *View: .. yes u'r right , I feel u getting it , He's the pixel artist >> who's in charge of displaying Model's data , got nothing to do with logic and stuff ..
   I think it's the same as what teacher did today 
_______-_-_-_-_ now why MVC ? ________ Becauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuse :
just by applying this.. , we've mostly done 1st objectif , 'cause By applying MVC  we achieve :
   -Separation of concerns
   -Reusability
   -Testability
   -Flexibility
   -Maintainability
   Awesome isn't it ! that's why we love coding Buds..
      */
      
      //Set what to get !! , always put setters before getters and separate them , if we were doing that we won't spent all that time seeking for that damn getter.. it isn't that necessary but it made things clearer bud..
   

/*now the code is functioning and there's no errors , but i feel something wrong about it ..
what I saw the teacher doing today is a bit diffrent .. his way of doing things is clearer more organised , but 
whenever i try to make it the same way.. I'm afraid to touch anyline honestly 'cause I'm barely catching things 


hadshi kaytelef jab lya doukha .. idk how to do what my teacher and collabs diiiid aaaaaaa
 .. i touch the code it won't function , i ask chat it makes things worst smtimes .. 

done of waiting till my code is perfect to commit this .. I confess it's full of gaps and there's a long way right above to became that good in java ..
